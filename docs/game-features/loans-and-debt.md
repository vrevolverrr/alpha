# ðŸ’¸ Loans and Debt

The loan system provides financing options for major purchases while introducing realistic debt management challenges.

## Loan Types

**Asset Loans**:
- **Purpose**: Real estate and vehicle purchases
- **Requirement**: Debt service ratio â‰¤ 70% of salary
- **Repayment**: Automatic from Savings Account
- **Interest**: Applied according to loan terms

**Business Loans**:
- **Purpose**: Business acquisition and operations
- **Requirement**: None (high accessibility)
- **Repayment**: Profit-first from business earnings
- **Loss Handling**: Losses added to principal debt
- **Interest**: No interest charges

## Debt Management Mechanics

**Asset Loan Calculation**:
```dart
maxMonthlyPayment = salary Ã— 0.70
availableLoanCapacity = maxMonthlyPayment - currentLoanPayments
```

**Business Debt Dynamics**:
```dart
// Profitable business
netEarnings = businessEarnings - debtRepayment

// Unprofitable business  
totalDebt = previousDebt + businessLosses
```

## Debt Impact on Scoring
