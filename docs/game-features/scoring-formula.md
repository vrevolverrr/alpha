# 🏆 Scoring Formula

The game employs a comprehensive scoring system that balances multiple financial and life success factors.

## Final Score Calculation

```
Final Score = (Total Assets × Happiness Factor) - Debt Penalty + Life Goal Bonus + ESG Team Bonus
```

## Scoring Components

**Total Assets** = Accounts + Portfolio + Business Valuation + Real Estate + Vehicles
```dart
totalAssets = savingsBalance + cpfBalance + investmentBalance + 
              portfolioValue + businessValuation + realEstateValue + vehicleValue
```

**Happiness Factor** = `max(1, happiness - 100 + 1)`
- Base happiness: 100
- Each happiness point above 100 adds to multiplier
- Minimum multiplier: 1 (no penalty below base happiness)
